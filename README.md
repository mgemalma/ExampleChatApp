# Lapit Chat - Android SDK Chat App

Lapit Chat is a chat application built using Android SDK and Firebase, following the [YouTube tutorial series by TVAC Studios](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGCjwl1RrtcQ3o2jmZtwu2wXEA4OIIq53). The tutorial provided the core structure and functionality, and I implemented minor tweaks to enhance certain features and usability.
