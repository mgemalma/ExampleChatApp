# Lapit Chat - Android SDK Chat App

Lapit Chat is a chat application developed using Android SDK and Firebase, based on the [YouTube tutorial series by TVAC Studios](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGCjwl1RrtcQ3o2jmZtwu2wXEA4OIIq53). The tutorial series provided the foundational structure for building a Firebase-powered chat app, which I followed closely. I've also added comments throughout the code to clarify various sections and enhance learning.

## Features

- Real-time messaging
- Firebase authentication and database
- Profile customization
- Push notifications
- And more...

## Getting Started

To get started with Lapit Chat, clone this repository and open it in Android Studio. Follow the instructions within the code comments to set up Firebase and any other dependencies.
